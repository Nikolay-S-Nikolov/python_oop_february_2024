associative array -abstract data type like dictionaries of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at
most once in the collection. Any key of the dictionary is associated (or mapped) to a value. The values of a dictionary
can be any type of Python data. So, dictionaries are unordered key-value-pairs. Dictionaries are implemented as hash tables

In computing, a hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a
structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code,
into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the
resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored.

hash collision - It’s when two keys produce identical hash code, leading distinct values to collide with each other
at the same index in the hash table
